	      <h3>Mission and philosophy</h3>
	    </header>
	    <div class="content">
	      <p>The mission of the Millennium Nucleus on Young Exoplanets and their Moons (YEMS) is to promote research through interdisciplinary connections between astrophysics and informatics engineering. The Center will create bridges to explore the multidisciplinary nature of these disciplines.

	      <h3>Expectations of YEMS members </h3>
	    </header>
	    <div class="content">
	      <p> <strong>All YEMS members are expected to have a genuine passion and fascination with the scientific questions which drive the center. YEMS members are expected to recognize the importance of self-care, recognizing that our minds and bodies are our windows to the universe. YEMS members should support each other in this process and recognize every individual's unique struggles. YEMS members should respect and listen to one another.</strong> There are no bad ideas, and our task is to identify the most promising research avenues. We recognize that creativity is the most important ability of a scientist and foster it through open discussions. However, we also recognize that creativity alone is wasted without investing the time and energy necessary to realize our ideas. We are willing to fail and take risks, acknowledging that not every venture can succeed but that this process is fundamental to scientific advances. YEMS members are expected to acknowledge the great importance of presenting results with a commitment to clarity and transparency and to nurture their own unique style of expression. YEMS members are encouraged to engage in public outreach and science communication in whatever form they prefer.
	      </p>
	      <p>All YEMS members are expected to follow the Iniciativa Científica Milenio's <a =href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f-55vEyiAfOHNPtA-Cw_bX7AmF7xiKvj/view?usp=sharing">manual for acknowledgements in works and publications</a>. In publications, this involves including YEMS as affiliation and as an acknowledgement. For example, a paper including a YEMS member must include</p>

	      <blockquote>Millennium Nucleus on Young Exoplanets and their Moons (YEMS)</blockquote>

	      <p>as one of their affiliations, and also include the following text in the acknowledgement section</p>

	      <blockquote>This work was funded by ANID --Millennium Science Initiative Program-- Center Code NCN2021_080.</blockquote>
	      
	      <p>If you are not sure whether the YEMS affiliation and acknowledgement apply to your work, please ask your closest YEMS PI and/or the YEMS directors.</p>

	      <p>This code of conduct was adapted from the <a href="https://www.coolworldslab.com/philosophy">Cool Worlds Lab group's code</a> which in turn was adapted from <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/corrales-research-group/code-of-conduct?fref=gc">Dr Lia Corrales group's</a>, which, in turn, was adapted from the <a href="https://dxl.ncsa.illinois.edu/docs/meta.html">Data Exploration Lab's code</a>. We also borrowed some ideas from the Deep Sky Lab Terms of Collaboration (private communication). </p>
